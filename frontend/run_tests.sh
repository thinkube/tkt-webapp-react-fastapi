# arm64 — and npm reads it back as a corrupt tree ("Cannot read properties
# of null (reading 'edgesOut')"). npm's own default, or npm_config_cache

# A type check and a linter are things a person runs while writing, and
# `npm run typecheck` and `npm run lint` are here for that. On every
# deploy they cost minutes — TypeScript alone must read the declarations
# of every library the app imports — and they answer a question the tests
# have already answered: does this work. Coverage instruments every file
# to print a report nobody reads on a deploy.
